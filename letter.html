      <p>Esteemed Delegates and Directors,<br><br>It is our utmost pleasure to welcome you to the eighth annual TASMUN conference held in Taipei, Taiwan from April 29th to 30th, 2017!<br/><br>We are excited to build upon the previous efforts of past TASMUN conferences to promote diplomacy and raise awareness about issues of monumental importance by providing delegates with innumerable opportunities to practice and build upon their critical thinking, negotiation, and communication skills, working alongside other delegates and experienced student officers to create solutions for the problems the world faces today. The rigorous debate, excelled participants, and the sublime topics will undoubtedly provide the most pristine experience to all participants, regardless of age, experience, or position.
<br><br>We aim to move beyond simply lobbying and debating to true global awareness by continuing with our Afghanistan Drive Initiative, fundraising for HELA, an organization in Afghanistan which works to spread Model United Nations to Afghan teenagers. Not only we will continue to provide our specialized UN4MUN committees that provide truly authentic United Nations experiences, for the very first time ever we are introducing the Historical Security Council; allowing our own delegates to delve into the past and explore what our world would be like, had the UN made a different decision. Together, it is our hope that in doing so, TASMUN delegates become true global citizens and gain a deeper understanding of the problems that plague our world, and truly embrace tomorrow.<br><br>Thank you for your interest in TASMUN and we hope to see you in April!
<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Niralee Shah and Ryan Sun<br>
      Secretaries General<br>
      TASMUN VIII
