    <h3 class="item-title">Our Mission: “Create and sustain impact for future leaders at TASMUN!”</h3>
<p>There are many creative ways to bring a higher level of impact and awareness about the SDGs to our Model UN program - as we make conscious decisions and changes. This year we are introducing a brand new activity - the “Global Impact Fair”!
             <br>We will be hosting a fair (under COVID-19 regulations) to present some efforts that had been made prior to the conference. We are accepting all projects - the criterias are as shown in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaF_i5rZxa2ZZWokOQ4-6RjVhxPQjgZMaHVYiBoL7o6h6IjA/viewform" target="_blank">digital submission form</a>.</P>

            <ul>Organize a recycling, cleanup, volunteering event</ul>
              <ul>… at an animal shelter</ul>
              <ul>… elderly homes</ul>

        </p>
