  <h3 class="item-title">Why - what is the purpose?</h3>
           <p>Our goal is to raise awareness and encourage action to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), our goal will be to collect 886 (Taiwan’s Region Code) submissions - this will need the help of your dedicated commitment and leadership! With our total numbers, our secretariat team will officially send this to the UN organizations associated with the challenge. 
             <br> The SDGs: Are a call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. The member states of the UN adopted them to acknowledge that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. (The 17 global goals are interlinked, which means that taking action in one area will have an impact on others). </P>
