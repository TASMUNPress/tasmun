          <h2 class="section-title">What is the #100kDeeds Challenge?</h2>
          <p>The  #100,000 Deeds is a campaign designed to raise awareness and encourage action to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This year, our program will also make specific commitments to take a small action to support the SDGs, in particular the 10th (Reduced Inequalitiesb).</p>
          <h2 class="section-title">When will this take place? </h2>
          <p>This year’s secretariat is accepting ALL digital and physical submissions (linked below) up until the week of TASMUN itself - April 12th. Everyone is welcome and highly encouraged! </p>
          <h2 class="section-title">Why - what is the purpose?</h2>
          <p>Our goal is to raise awareness and encourage action to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), our goal will be to collect 886 (Taiwan’s Region Code) submissions - this will need the help of your dedicated commitment and leadership! With our total numbers, our secretariat team will officially send this to the UN organizations associated with the challenge. 
             <br> The SDGs: Are a call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. The member states of the UN adopted them to acknowledge that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. (The 17 global goals are interlinked, which means that taking action in one area will have an impact on others). </P>
          <h2 class="section-title">How can we participate? </h2>
          <p>Taking part is easy: all you need to do is choose a SDG and a deed (either from our suggestions or one of your own ideas), complete the deed and record it on a Deed Card, then upload it to our website. 
             <li>
              <ol>For TAS Students: find these deed cards around school, and submit them through a “100K Deeds Box” (also spread around the campus). </ol>
              <ol>For everyone: OR complete through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaF_i5rZxa2ZZWokOQ4-6RjVhxPQjgZMaHVYiBoL7o6h6IjA/viewform" target="_blank">digital submission form</a>! </ol>
