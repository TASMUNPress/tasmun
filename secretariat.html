      <p>It is my absolute privilege to  serve as your Secretary-General this year. TASMUN IX will serve as my 17th conference, circling back to where I started my very first MUN experience. Both my middle school and high school day to day commitments have and still continue to exemplify my active involvement with Model UN because of my passion  for global politics and our footprint in the world. As such, this year’s conference theme, MUN Impact, aims to shift the focus of MUN to taking real-life actions, which we hope will have a positive ripple effect. My goal is to revolutionize the purpose of MUN, starting from the initiative to transition the focus of our work to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. You will see that our issues and committees this year are solely based on different SDG themes and targets. My team and I are thrilled to have you join us at TASMUN this year, and hope to bring you a uniquely different Model UN experience. As preparations for the conference gear up, I am more than enthusiastic to see you in April 2018! I would like to invite you to come up and speak to me any time during the conference and would be delighted to share my experiences or answer any questions you may have. A warm welcome to the TASMUN 2018 family, I hope to see you soon! </p>

      <p>My name is April Tsai, a junior at Taipei American School. I started my Model United Nations career in 6th grade as a page for this very conference!

      <p>With #MUNImpact as our conference theme this year, we aim to bring to all of you an MUN experience like no other. As such, we have decided to focus each of our committees on one particular Sustainable Development Goal, allowing delegates to discuss some of the most pressing issues our world faces today. </p>
      <p> With that, I wish the best of luck with your preparations and I look forward to meeting all of you in April 2018. Here’s to an amazing conference!</p>

      <p>My name is Selene Kung. I am currently a junior at Taipei American School, and this is my  fourth year in MUN. I began MUN in 8th grade, when English was still my second language. Imagine making impromptu speeches in a second language—it was probably the first great challenge of my life. Terrifying as it was, my English ability and general confidence skyrocketed, all because of MUN. </p><p>In the past four years I have experienced different aspects of MUN and enjoyed participating in the cultivation of the next generation of leaders. I am honored to serve as one of your Deputy Secretaries-General for TASMUN IX, and I hope that TASMUN builds up your confidence and love of MUN, as it did for me.</p> <p>With our theme of the Sustainable Development Goals, we aim to present the broad array of issues around the globe and its proximity to us. I look forward to seeing you all grow as  speakers and  global citizens in TASMUN 2018.</p>

      <p>As a junior attending Taipei American School, I am honored to serve as your Deputy Secretary-General of TASMUN IX this year. TASMUN IX will be my 12th conference, and I am excited to meet all of you! MUN inspired my interest in international affairs and political science; thus, it is my pleasure to spread that inspiration to other participants. </p>
<p>MUN is not just about debate and raising awareness about the problems of our world. It helps future leaders develop an international worldview and a deeper understanding about today’s pressing issues . The Sustainable Development Goals are perfect in facilitating that development, as they not only establish tangible goals for the current generation, but also inspire the next generation to make a difference. </p> <p>I wish you best of luck in preparing for this year’s TASMUN XI.</p>

      <p>This year, with our conference focusing on the topic of the Sustainable Development Goals put forth in 2015, I would like to invite you all to think critically about the importance of sustainability when developing possible solutions to solve the various issues of our time. </p> <p>With that said, I wish you the best of luck in your preparations for the conference, and I hope to see you all there! </p>

      <p>I am Ethan Wu, a junior at Taipei American School.  I have participated in MUN for the past five years, starting with my first TASMUN conference in 2013.  After attending a number of conferences across Asia, I am excited and honored to have made the full loop back to serve as one of your Deputy Secretaries-General for TASMUN IX.
</p>
<p>Many of the global problems we face today are, in part, consequences of earlier short-sighted decisions. I would thus like to encourage all delegates to take the opportunity of TASMUN 2018’s emphasis on the Sustainable Development Goals to begin thinking about issues and solutions in terms of sustainability, to transcend the present and look to the future.</p> <p>I hope that TASMUN IX will be an informative and memorable experience for everyone!</p>

<p>As an annual TASMUN participant since joining Model United Nations in 6th grade, I have been dedicated to MUN not just as an activity, but also as an institution, and have come to deeply value its culture of mentorship. I look forward to making TASMUN a comfortable space where all delegates—both experienced and inexperienced—can grow into their roles as global citizens! </p>
