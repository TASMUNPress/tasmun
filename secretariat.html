      <h4 class="item-subtitle">Deputy Secretary-General of Chair Training </h4>
      <p>Greetings fellow MUNers! As you can probably tell from the title above, my name is Jason. This year, I will be serving as your deputy secretary-general for chair training at TASMUN XI.  Alongside Dokyong R., we will be training the chairs to be comfortable with their tasks and procedures so that the optimal debate experience can be achieved. We will also be checking their chair reports so that the delegates will be reading insightful information. TASMUN XI will be my 11th conference and this marks my 6th year participating in the MUN program. Throughout the years, I have made new friends, learned new cultures, and expanded my love for global politics and issues through MUN. TASMUN, without a doubt, does a great job of achieving all of the above. I hope that you are just as excited as me for this upcoming conference! </p>

      <p>Welcome to TASMUN 2020! My name is Dokyong and I will be serving as a Deputy Secretary-General of Chair Training this year. Jason and I will be working together to guide chairs with their duties and ensure standard committee procedures are followed to develop the best debate environment and experience possible. TASMUN XI will be my 13th conference since starting MUN in 6th grade, and I am very excited to have this opportunity to give back to the community which has allowed me to educate myself on issues worldwide, discuss with passionate delegates and chairs, and brainstorm multilateral efforts while understanding the complexities of our world today. Regardless of your research and public speaking abilities, all you need to participate in MUN are small steps of courage and a passion to learn. I can’t wait to see you all in April 2020!</p>

      <p>Hello, and welcome to TASMUN XI! My name is Nicole S., and I will be serving as your Deputy Secretary General of Mentoring along with Megan B. this year. Our goal is to create an effective mentoring system to support delegates in their process of resolution writing and researching. I am currently a junior at Taipei American School and I have been actively involved in the MUN program since I was in eighth grade. I first joined MUN as a terrible public speaker who needed to learn to speak in front of a crowd; I ended up learning about global issues, proper research methodology, and seeing the world through different political perspectives. With that being said, I hope that this conference can help you discover your own point of view in regards to global politics and I look forward to meeting you all in April! </p>

      <p>Greetings! Welcome to TASMUN XI! My name is Lucy K. and I am a junior attending Taipei American School. I will be serving as a Deputy Secretary General of administration for publications along with Erica and Rachel. Our goal this year is to ensure that the conference progresses without any issues and to create a friendly environment for delegates to actively be involved.

      <p>Hello, and welcome to TASMUN XI! My name is Rachel S., and I will be serving as one of your Deputy Secretary Generals of Administration along with Lucy and Erica. I began participating in MUN in 8th grade as a delegate at TASMUN, and I have been actively involved with the program ever since. MUN is unique in its ability to transform not just ourselves, but the world itself. Personally, MUN has opened my eyes to many aspects of the world previously unknown to me and cultivated my passion for social justice and feminism. I sincerely believe that this year’s TASMUN will be a forum of open discussion on the relevant issues of our time, and develop each participant’s speaking, researching, and debating abilities. With that in mind, I implore each and every one of you to make your voices heard, and amplify the voices of those who do not have the same privileges as we do.</p>

      <p>Hello! I’m Derek C., a junior at Taipei American School. I will be serving as the Deputy Secretary of Committees and will be focusing primarily on specialized committees. It has been a great honor and privilege watching our TASMUN conference evolve over these past years, and I can’t be more excited to share TASMUN XI with all of you guys! I still remember attending my first TASMUN, waiting eagerly to enter the Disarmament Committee as the enthusiastic delegate of Nepal. Since then, my years in the MUN program has only furthered my interest for politics, international affairs, and different cultures in general. It is only appropriate that for our 11th inaugural TASMUN, we reflect on how to create a world that represents the opinions of everyone fairly and equally. Indeed, by the end of this TASMUN, we seek to give everyone a new insight into the wealth of missed opportunities and how to seize them in the future. I look forward to an extraordinary TASMUN XI. Carpe Diem!</p>
