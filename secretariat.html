      <p>Welcome to TASMUN X! I am Angela Wang, a junior at TAS, and I will be serving as your Deputy Secretary General
        for Fundraising. When I began my MUN journey in seventh grade, I was timid and shy, just like many others.
        Nevertheless, debating about past successes and failures has made me realize that we should work beyond
        proposing solutions on paper, but to create a greater impact for our future amidst the unprecedented
        difficulties. For this year’s TASMUN, we are focusing on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities
        and Development. We want you to take your first step in your journey of making our world more sustainable and
        to dictate a change for tomorrow we all share. Remember to seize all opportunities and take action. See you
        there at the conference!</p>

      <p>My name is Cindy Li, and I am a junior at Taipei American School. I began my MUN journey in 7th grade as a
        delegate in TASMUN, so it is my absolute honour to come back full circle and serve as the Deputy Secretary
        General for Chair Training this year. I have had a fulfilling MUN experience, participating in conferences all
        over Europe and Asia over the years. Seeing as this year's focus is on SDG Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and
        Communities, I would like to encourage you to think of ways that you can make your local communities more
        inclusive in the face of rapid urbanization. Ultimately, I think it is important to keep in mind that MUN is
        not just about making speeches or winning awards, it is about the possibilities that you can create with these
        ideas to make an actual difference in your daily lives. With that said, I hope you all have a great time at
        TASMUN X, and I look forward meeting you in April!</p>

      <p>Hello and welcome to TASMUN X! My name is Dhirpal Shah, a junior at Taipei American School, and I will be
        serving as Deputy Secretary General for Delegate Mentorship at this conference. One of the best things about
        TASMUN – and the MUN program as a whole – is the cycle of taking and giving back. As a middle schooler, I
        learned many things from high school students who had taken their time to come teach me about the world of MUN.
        Fortunately, I have been able to continue with this program to the point in which I am now able to give back to
        delegates in the form of mentorship. This year at TASMUN, we are striving to focus on Goal 11 of the
        Sustainable Development Goals: Sustainable Cities and Communities. Taipei itself is a brilliant example of an
        efficient and sustainable city - the education system is exemplar and the public transportation in this city is
        second to none. It was these developments that allowed Taipei to develop so rapidly as a city, so this year, I
        urge delegates to think outside the box to come up with solutions that would develop cities across the world
        just as fast. This is what we are looking for at TASMUN X – delegates that want to constantly improve every
        city in every country. See you there!</p>

      <p>Greetings, I'm Emily Hsu and it's my honor to be serving as your Deputy Secretary-General of Administration
        and Page Coordination at TASMUN X. MUN has played a huge role in my life in not only opening up my perception
        of the world, but also understanding the importance of speaking up for those whose voices are suppressed.
        Today’s rapidly developing world creates countless opportunities, but also irreversible consequences. Although
        fear may be the predominating emotion when faced with so many new challenges, we must step forth with courage
        and a vision to create a more sustainable future. The purpose of MUN is often clouded with fancy words and even
        fancier apparel, so as you step into this conference, I want to encourage you to remember the voices of this
        world and the hope that lies in today's generation to bring change for tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Hello, and welcome to TASMUN X! My name is Anna Chang, a junior from Taipei American School. I have been
        involved in MUN ever since middle school, as a press team member at my first TASMUN conference, and I have
        taken every opportunity to give back to the program that kickstarted my MUN career, whether as a delegate, a
        mentor, or a chair. And now, I have the honor of serving as your Deputy Secretary General of delegate
        mentorship. This year, our conference theme is "Your Today for Our Tomorrow". In the midst of rapid change, we
        must take the time to examine the potential effects of our current actions, in an effort to prevent repeating
        past mistakes or to build a more desirable future for our generation. We hope that through the TASMUN X
        conference, you will realize the power the youth has to direct the course of change, and take your chance to
        make that change.</p>

      <p>Hello! I’m Dylan Sun, a junior at Taipei American School, and I will be serving as the Deputy Secretary
        General for Chair Training. It has been a great honor and privilege watching our TASMUN conference evolve over
        these past years, and I can’t be more excited to share TASMUN X with all of you guys! I still remember
        attending my first TASMUN, waiting eagerly to enter the Environment Committee as one of the two press delegates
        to take photos and document the debate. Since then, my years in the MUN program has only furthered my interest
        for politics, international affairs, and different cultures in general. It is only appropriate that for our
        10th inaugural TASMUN, we reflect on how to create a sustainable world for all amidst an ever changing world.
        Indeed, by the end of this TASMUN, we seek to give everyone a new insight into the wealth of missed
        opportunities and how to seize them in the future. I look forward to an extraordinary TASMUN X!</p>

      <p>Hello, and welcome to TASMUN X! My name is Emily Wang, I am currently a junior at Taipei American School, and
        it is an honor to be serving as your Deputy Secretary of Administration-Management Systems this year. I started
        MUN in 8th grade as a delegate, and as an incredibly shy middle schooler, MUN was a huge departure from my
        original comfort zone. However, what I found in the MUN program truly changed my perception of the world and my
        role in it, and helped me to become more confident and speak up about my views. To do my part for this year’s
        topic, “Your Today For Our Tomorrow”, I hope to give back to the MUN community for all it’s given me, and for
        everyone to consider all the ways in which we can give back to the world and the community by supporting the
        future generations economically, politically, socially, and environmentally. As the youth of today, we are key
        to the success of the future, and through the TASMUN X conference, we can learn from the successes and failures
        of the past and present in order to build a bright future for us all. I look forward to a wonderful conference!
